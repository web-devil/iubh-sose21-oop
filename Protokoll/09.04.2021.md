Terminal
--------
- also: Command Line, Shell, Bash, ....
- Terminal allows us to navigate through folders
- Commands can be execute
- `pwd` show current path
- `cd` change directory
- `ls` list content of current directory (it can be `dir` on Windowns if PowerShell)

Git Introduction
----------------
- Git is a command line tool for version control
- `git clone url` clones url from "Git-Server" to local computer and puts the
repository into a new folder 
- `git pull` pulls updates/changes from "Git-Server" to local computer
- `git status` list curernt changes for commit
- `git add file` adds a file to git (so that the changes are tracked by Git)
- `git commit -m "message"` logical group of changes 
- `git push` upload local commits to "Git-Server"

Compiler and Interpeter
-----------------------
- `python helloworld.py`
- vs `javac Main.java && java Main``
- Python is interpreted; direct execution of code
- Java is compiled*; source code -> binary -> executed
- * in fact Java is a little bit more tricky with the JVM but this is not
covered in this course

Hello World
-----------
```
public class Main {
    // main  Methode ist der EINSTIEGSPUNKT von JAVA
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // AUSGABE
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

Java Execution
--------------
- create folder for your project!
- Terminal: cd in the created folder
- ! IMPORTANT ! keep your folder structure clean and make sure your Terminal is
in the correct directory
- create Main.java file containing the source code
- compile the source code into binary with `javac Main.java`
- run the programm `java Main` (we omit .class but the binary file Main.class
will be executed)

Homework
--------
Make sure, that Hello World runs on your local computer.
Familiarize yourself with your IDE (e.g. VS Code) and Terminal!
